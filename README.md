## Remember - A Memory Game

This game was inspired by a series of videos
([example](https://youtu.be/zsXP8qeFF6A)) examining chimpanzees' ability to
beat humans in simple memory games.

## Description

This game uses an 8x8 matrix display on which circles appear in a certain
order, which you will have to recreate. As the difficulty increases, you will
have to remember the order of more of these circles.

## How To Play

* From the Main Menu, select the 'Start Game' option.
* Each game level starts by displaying a number of red circles in a random
  order.
* After the previously described stage ends, the player is positioned on the
  first red circle in the sequence.
* At this point, if you wish to view the order of the circles once again, press
  the button for one second and then release. Keep in mind, though, you have a
  limited number of reviews.
* When you're ready to start reconstructing the original order, you can move
  around with the joystick and select the circles by pressing the button.
* At the end of the game, if your score is in the Top 5, you will be prompted
  for your name, which will be registered in the leaderboard.
